                    <h2>UNIT 2: Agile software development</h2>
                    <br>
                    <section>
                        <h3>2.1 Agile methods</h3><br>
                        <p>Agile Software Development is a methodology emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction, rooted in the Agile Manifesto's principles prioritizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and response to change. It focuses on iterative and incremental development, delivering working products quickly and frequently through close collaboration between development teams and customers.</p><br>
                        <p>Key advantages of Agile include creating tangible value promptly, concentrating on value-added work, fostering a mindset of adaptability, and facilitating quick responses to changing requirements. Agile promotes regular demonstrations of project progress, cross-functional teams, and values over processes and tools. The Agile Manifesto outlines four core values and twelve principles guiding methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, Continuous Integration, Test-Driven Development, and Pair Programming.</p><br>
                        <p>The Agile software development process involves requirements gathering, planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It is widely used for its adaptability to changing requirements and fast-paced development environments. Agile promotes a time-bound, iterative approach, breaking projects into iterations and delivering working software incrementally.</p><br>
                        <p>Comparing Agile with traditional approaches, it offers increased customer satisfaction, faster time-to-market, reduced risk, improved team collaboration, adaptability to change, better quality software, increased transparency, higher productivity, and improved project control.

                    </section>
                    
                    <section>
                        <h3>2.2 Plan-driven and agile development</h3><br>
                        <p>Software development encompasses various methodologies, including Plan-Driven Development (PDD), which aims to plan and develop all features of a final product beforehand. PDD relies on structured project plans, resource allocation, risk analysis, and monitoring systems to ensure project success. It is suitable for large-scale projects with stable requirements and environments, requiring knowledgeable personnel at the beginning.</p><br>
                        <p>Advantages of PDD include its suitability for extensive systems, effective management of hazardous projects, and achievement through construction and direction. However, it suffers from inflexibility in accommodating changes, longer development cycles, lack of user involvement, and high costs for dynamic environments.</p><br>
                        <p>Other popular software development models include Incremental Development, Prototype Model, Iterative Development, Rapid Application Development, Spiral Development, and Software Process Model, each with its own characteristics and suitability.</p><br>
                        <p>The planning process in PDD involves iterative project planning, adapting to changing requirements and business goals. Agile and Plan-Driven Development can coexist, with PDD not necessarily following a waterfall model but incorporating incremental growth and delivery.</p><br>
                        <p>Experts suggest that PDD allows organizations to address organizational issues and potential problems before the project begins, with dependency discovery checks performed throughout. However, a major concern with PDD is the need for frequent modifications as environmental changes affect the software's development and usage.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.4 Agile project management</h3><br>
                        <p>Agile project management is a dynamic approach to managing software development, emphasizing continuous releases and customer feedback with every iteration. Traditionally, agile project management is categorized into two frameworks: Scrum and Kanban. Scrum follows fixed-length project iterations, while Kanban focuses on continuous releases, swiftly transitioning to the next phase after completing each iteration.</p><br>
                        <p>The history of agile project management traces back to the mid-20th century, with concepts like Rapid Iterative Production Prototyping (RIPP) and Rapid Application Development (RAD) paving the way. However, the most recent and prevalent framework is Scrum, which involves creating a product backlog and prioritizing features for rapid incremental development.</p><br>
                        <p>Agile project management relies on teams to regularly assess cost and time using metrics like velocity, burnup, and burndown charts instead of traditional Gantt charts and milestones. Continuous development and integration are core practices, facilitated by automation to accelerate product release and utilization.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.5 Scaling agile methods</h3><br>
                        <p>Scaling Agile methods to suit larger organizations involves adapting frameworks like Scrum and Kanban to accommodate multiple teams and projects. Two popular methods for scaling Agile are the Scrum of Scrums and the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).</p><br>
                        <p>The Scrum of Scrums is a framework used when several Scrum teams collaborate on a big project. It involves small meetings where Scrum Masters discuss the Agile process, with each team represented by a member, typically someone in a technical role.</p><br>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), pioneered by Dean Leffingwell, offers a structured approach to scaling Agile. It defines three organizational levels: portfolio, program, and team, making it suitable for larger organizations. SAFe employs a tiered approach for work delivery, with a focus on themes, business epics, and architectural stories.</p><br>

                        <h3>3.5 Model-driven engineering</h3><br>
                        <p>Model-driven development (MDD) is a methodology aimed at rapidly and cost-effectively building software by constructing a software model before generating code. Also referred to as model-driven software development (MDSD), model-driven engineering (MDE), and model-driven architecture (MDA), MDD simplifies the engineering process by focusing on creating a model that specifies the intended behaviors of the software system. The approach involves collaborative construction of models by individuals and teams, facilitating clear communication and faster development cycles.</p><br>
                        <p>Key benefits of MDD include increased productivity, clearer definitions of software functionality, and faster testing, rebuilding, and redeployment. The core concepts of MDD include abstraction and automation. Abstraction organizes complex software systems, simplifying code definition, while automation transforms the abstraction into a working software model using domain-specific languages (DSLs) and scripting languages.</p><br>
                        <p>Agile software development methods are often integrated with MDD, resulting in Agile model-driven development (AMDD). AMDD utilizes short development iterations, allowing for changes to be quickly incorporated into the model and the code. MDD tools like Rational Software Architect, Simulink, and Sirius facilitate the creation of models. These tools use Unified Modeling Language (UML), graphical modeling, and DSLs to design and simulate software, automatically generate code, and create models without requiring extensive technical knowledge.</p><br>

                        <p>Architectural design in software engineering is crucial for defining the framework of a computer system, encompassing both hardware and software components along with their interfaces. Various architectural styles are employed to organize these components, each serving different purposes and exhibiting unique characteristics.</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data-centered architectures: These architectures feature a central data store accessed by other components for data manipulation. The repository is independent of clients, promoting integrability and ease of modification. Data can be passed among clients using mechanisms like the blackboard model.</li><br>
                            <li>Data flow architectures: These architectures transform input data into output data through a series of computational components. They encourage maintenance, repurposing, and support concurrent execution. However, they may degenerate into batch sequential systems and lack support for user-engaging applications.</li><br>
                            <li>Call and Return architectures: Substyles within this category include remote procedure call architecture and main program/subprogram architectures. They facilitate scalability and modification by organizing programs into control hierarchies and distributing them across multiple computers on a network.</li><br>
                            <li>Object-oriented architecture: Components encapsulate data and operations, with communication facilitated through message passing. This architecture enables designers to separate challenges into autonomous objects, protecting system integrity and allowing changes without impacting other objects.</li><br>
                            <li>Layered architecture: This style defines different layers, each performing well-defined operations. Layers progress from user interface operations to system interfacing and application software functions.

                        <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a development process where test cases are written before the code they validate. It relies on a short development cycle, where tests are continuously written, code is implemented to pass those tests, and then refactored to improve quality. The TDD process follows a sequence of steps: writing a test case based on requirements, ensuring it fails initially, writing code to pass the test, running test cases, and refactoring to remove redundancy.</p><br>
                        <p>The motto of TDD is encapsulated in the phrases "Red", "Green", and "Refactor". Developers first create a failing test case (Red), then make it pass by any means necessary (Green), and finally refactor the code to improve design and remove duplication.</p><br>
                        <p>TDD offers several benefits, including constant feedback on code functionality, improved design quality leading to easier maintenance, acting as a safety net against bugs, ensuring that the application meets defined requirements, and maintaining a short development lifecycle.</p><br>

                        <h3>5.7 Availability and reliability</h3><br>
                        <p>Reliability and availability are fundamental concepts in technology and system design.</p><br>
                        <p>Reliability refers to how often a system, component, or process performs its required functions without breaking down or failing. It's essential for ensuring consistent performance and meeting user expectations. For instance, a reliable car starts every morning without issues, a website loads quickly and error-free, and a machine operates smoothly without frequent breakdowns.</p><br>
                        <p>Availability measures a system or service's ability to be operational and accessible when needed. Expressed as a percentage, it represents the ratio of time a system is available for use to the total time it should be available, considering both planned and unplanned downtime. For example, a website with 99% availability is operational and accessible 99% of the time, with 1% downtime for maintenance or unexpected issues.</p><br>
                        <p>In essence, reliability focuses on how well something works, while availability focuses on how often it's ready to be used. Both concepts are critical for ensuring system performance, meeting user needs, and maintaining trust in technology.</p><br>
                        <p>Understanding the distinction between reliability and availability is essential in system design, maintenance, and troubleshooting. It allows engineers to assess and improve system performance, plan for downtime, and ensure a seamless user experience.</p><br>

                        <h3>5.8 Safety Security</h3><br>
                        <p>Software security is crucial for protecting computer programs and sensitive data from malicious attacks, encompassing various methods to ensure privacy, accuracy, and accessibility. External threats, like hackers and cybercriminals, pose risks to software integrity, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and compromised trust. Internal threats, such as insider misuse and human errors, also contribute to security vulnerabilities within organizations.</p><br>
                        <p>Key reasons for prioritizing software security include data protection, business continuity, regulatory compliance, user trust, and intellectual property protection. Failure to address security issues can result in severe consequences, including legal liabilities, revenue losses, and damage to reputation.</p><br>
                        <p>Challenges associated with software security include the complexity of software, evolving threat landscape, lack of awareness, resource constraints, and legacy systems. To mitigate these challenges, various tools and practices are employed, including static and dynamic application security testing, web application firewalls, intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, and secure coding practices.</p><br>
                        <p>Distinction between software security and cybersecurity lies in their scope and focus. While software security emphasizes securing individual applications and data, cybersecurity encompasses a broader range of digital assets, including networks, systems, and user training. Both are vital for protecting organizations against cyber threats and ensuring compliance with security standards and regulations.</p><br>
