                        <h3>1.5 Service Primitives:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Service primitives in network software are abstract operations defining the interface between applications or higher-layer protocols and the underlying network. They encompass basic actions required for network interaction and typically fall into two categories: Request Primitives and Indication Primitives.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Request Primitives:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used by applications to request network services.</li>
                            <li>Include operations like Connect, Send, Receive, and Disconnect.</li>
                            <li>Initiates actions such as establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and closing connections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Indication Primitives:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used by the network layer to notify applications about network events.</li>
                            <li>Include operations like Data Indication, Connect Indication, Disconnect Indication, and Error Indication.</li>
                            <li>Inform applications about incoming data, connection status changes, errors, or other network-related events.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Service primitives offer a standardized interface for network communication, ensuring consistency and predictability in interactions between applications and the network layer. They abstract the complexities of network communication, allowing developers to focus on application functionality.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It's crucial to note that the specific set of service primitives may vary based on network architecture, protocol stack, and programming interface. For instance, in the OSI model, service primitives are part of the Network Service Access Point (NSAP) interface, while in TCP/IP networking, they are exposed through socket programming interfaces like Berkeley sockets or Winsock.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Understanding service primitives is essential for network software development, enabling developers to interact with the network layer efficiently and effectively. They facilitate seamless communication between applications and the underlying network, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of networked systems.</p>

                            <li>Widely used in LANs and the internet due to its simplicity, scalability, and adaptability.</li><br>
                            <li>De facto standard for networking, favored for its practicality and real-world deployment.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Layers: OSI model has seven layers, offering a detailed framework, while TCP/IP model has four layers, providing a simpler approach.</li><br>
                            <li>Development: OSI model was developed as a theoretical framework, whereas TCP/IP model evolved from practical implementation and deployment.</li><br>
                            <li>Interoperability: Both models facilitate interoperability, but TCP/IP is more widely implemented, especially on the internet.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>In conclusion, while the OSI model provides a structured framework for understanding network architecture, the TCP/IP model is the primary reference for practical implementation and deployment, particularly in internet-based applications and services.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The Internet: A vast network of interconnected computers and devices, built on common communication protocols. It originated from ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense project aiming to create a resilient communication system during the Cold War.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>ARPANET:</strong> The precursor to the Internet, established in the late 1950s to ensure network resilience in case of a nuclear attack. It used digital packet-switching technology and grew from an initial test in 1969 with four nodes to cover much of the United States.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Transition to TCP/IP:</strong> The development of TCP/IP protocols by Cerf and Kahn in 1974 provided a flexible and robust framework for network communication. This transition facilitated the expansion of ARPANET into a more interconnected Internet.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>NSFNET:</strong> A network launched by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s to connect supercomputing centers and academic institutions, laying the groundwork for the modern Internet. It featured a backbone network with 56-kbps lines, later upgraded to 1.5 Mbps.</p>

                        <h3>1.8 Network Standardization:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Network standardization is crucial for ensuring that different systems and devices can communicate and work together. It helps establish open markets, promotes competition, and fosters innovation while maintaining compatibility. Here are the essential points:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Purpose of Standards:</strong> They define the rules and protocols for data communication to ensure interoperability among various vendors and systems. This leads to broader markets and encourages competition.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Types of Standards:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>De facto: These evolve naturally without formal approval, often becoming widely accepted through common use. Examples include HTTP and Bluetooth.</li><br>
                            <li>De jure: These are officially sanctioned by recognized standardization bodies. They undergo a formal process of development and approval. ISO and ITU are examples of organizations that create de jure standards.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Standardization Bodies:</strong> Key organizations involved in network standardization include:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3>1.9 Performance: Bandwidth and Latency</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Network performance is a measure of the quality and efficiency of a network as experienced by its users. Key parameters used to gauge network performance include bandwidth and latency. Here's a brief summary of these key concepts:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Bandwidth:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bandwidth represents the maximum data capacity a network can handle over a given time period, typically measured in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second (Bps). It can also refer to frequency range in analog systems, measured in Hertz (Hz).</li><br>
                            <li>It determines the maximum rate of data transfer but is not the same as speed. Higher bandwidth allows more data to be transmitted but doesn't guarantee faster data transfer.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Latency:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Latency is the delay between sending and receiving data in a network, measured in milliseconds (ms). It consists of several components: propagation time, transmission time, queuing time, and processing delay.</li><br>
                            <li>High latency can cause network bottlenecks, impacting bandwidth and performance. Low-latency networks are desirable for real-time applications like gaming and video conferencing.</li><br>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        <p>The Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) is an important metric in computer networks that indicates the maximum number of bits that can be in transit within a network at any given time. It is calculated by multiplying bandwidth by latency, reflecting the capacity of a network and its ability to handle data bursts.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Types of Delays in Computer Networks:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Transmission Delay:</strong> Time taken to transmit a packet from a source to the transmission medium.</li><br>
                            <li><strong>Propagation Delay:</strong> Time for a packet to travel through the transmission medium from source to destination.</li><br>
                            <li><strong>Queuing Delay:</strong> Time a packet spends waiting in a queue before processing. It varies based on network traffic and queue size. Queuing delay is influenced by network load, number of servers/links, and packet arrival rates.</li><br>
                            <li><strong>Processing Delay:</strong> Time for a router or switch to process and forward a packet. This depends on processor speed and the complexity of operations like header checks and TTL updates.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP):</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> BDP=Bandwidth×Latency.</li><br>
                            <li>It indicates the maximum number of bits that can be in transit within the network.</li><br>
                            <li>BDP is significant for determining optimal data burst sizes, link utilization, and protocol design.</li><br>

                        <h3>2.1 X.25:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>X.25 is a packet-switched technology from the 1970s used for data communication over analog telephone lines and dial-up networks. It established virtual connections for reliable packet transmission and was widely used in applications like ATM networks and credit card verification.</p><br>
                        <p>X.25 consists of three layers:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical Layer: Defines physical, electrical, and functional characteristics for interfacing with the network. X.21 is commonly used.</li><br>
                            <li>Data Link Layer: Ensures error-free and ordered delivery using the LAPB (Link Access Procedure Balanced) protocol.</li><br>
                            <li>Packet Layer: Defines packet format and virtual circuits. Virtual circuits can be established dynamically (virtual calls) or permanently.</li><br>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>In the 1980s, X.25 was used by public data networks like CompuServe and Telenet. In the 1990s, Frame Relay and Internet Protocol (IP) replaced it due to faster speeds and simpler configurations. Despite its decline, X.25 is still used in applications requiring high reliability, such as ATMs and credit card verification. Its robustness and error correction make it a reliable, though outdated, packet-switched technology.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.2 Frame Relay:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Frame Relay is a packet-switching technology used in Wide Area Networks (WANs) for high-speed data transmission between Local Area Networks (LANs). It operates at the data link layer and establishes virtual circuits to connect multiple LANs. Virtual circuits can be permanent (PVC) or temporary (SVC), providing flexibility for data transmission across shared network infrastructure.</p><br>
                        <p>The key feature of Frame Relay is its minimal overhead due to the absence of intermediate error-checking and flow control, making it faster and more efficient than other protocols like X.25. This design allows for high-speed data transmission, ranging from 1.544 Mbps to 44.376 Mbps, and supports bursty data transfer, ideal for scenarios with variable data loads.</p><br>
                        <p>Frame Relay achieves its efficiency by dividing data into frames and transmitting them across a network of switches. Each frame contains a Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI), which guides the packet to its destination. The network's frame relay switches use these identifiers to forward frames to the correct virtual circuit, enabling communication across WANs.</p><br>
                        <p>To manage congestion, Frame Relay uses three key mechanisms: Forward Explicit Congestion Notification (FECN), Backward Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN), and Discard Eligibility (DE). FECN alerts the destination of congestion during transmission, while BECN informs the source to reduce the transmission rate. DE indicates which frames have lower priority and can be discarded first during congestion.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.3 ATM:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a high-performance networking technology used to transmit various types of data, including voice, video, and regular data traffic, in fixed-size packets known as "cells." Each ATM cell is 53 bytes long, with a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload.</p><br>
                        <p>ATM networks use virtual circuits for data transmission, with Virtual Path Connections (VPCs) and Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs). VPCs are bundles of VCCs, providing flexible routing through the network. This structure allows ATM to support multiple service types with varying quality of service (QoS) requirements, making it suitable for applications like multimedia and high-speed data transfer.</p><br>
                        <p>ATM operates in a connection-oriented manner, reserving a path before transmission, contrasting with connectionless protocols like Internet Protocol (IP). This design ensures consistent routing, reducing the chance of packet loss. ATM also uses cell switching, allowing for fast and efficient data transfer.</p><br>
                        <p>ATM's architecture includes the ATM Adaption Layer (AAL), which converts higher-layer data into cells, the Physical Layer for bitstream transmission, and the ATM Layer, responsible for switching, congestion control, and cell relay. Virtual Path Identifiers (VPIs) and Virtual Channel Identifiers (VCIs) guide cells through the network.</p><br>
                        <p>ATM has various applications, including Wide Area Networks (WANs), multimedia virtual private networks, frame relay backbone, and residential broadband networks. Its flexibility and high-speed capabilities make it a valuable solution for complex networking scenarios, especially where a range of service qualities is needed.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.4 Ethernet (802.3):</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ethernet connects computers via cables in wired networks or through wireless technologies. Wired Ethernet uses coaxial, twisted pair, or fiber optic cables to establish connections, allowing high-speed data transfer and reliability. Wireless Ethernet uses radio waves and wireless NICs to connect devices, providing more flexibility but potentially slower speeds.</p><br>
                        <p>Ethernet networks can support various topologies, including bus and star, and use the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) algorithm to manage data collisions. This algorithm resolves collisions by forcing devices to back off for a random time before retrying, promoting efficient data transmission.</p><br>
                        <p>Ethernet has various versions based on the IEEE 802.3 standard. Classic Ethernet, like 10BASE-5 and 10BASE-2, used coaxial cables, while modern Ethernet employs twisted pair or fiber optics, with speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps. Switched Ethernet replaces repeaters with switches, allowing full bandwidth utilization and improved performance.</p><br>
                        <p>Ethernet frames have several key fields, including:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preamble: Provides timing and synchronization for transmission.</li><br>
                            <li>Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD): Indicates the beginning of the frame.</li><br>
                            <li>Destination and Source Addresses: Six-byte fields for physical addresses.</li><br>
                            <li>Length/Type: Indicates the length of the data field or the frame's type.</li><br>
                            <li>Data: Carries variable-sized payloads, with a maximum of 1500 bytes.</li><br>
                            <li>Padding: Ensures the minimum frame length of 46 bytes.</li><br>
                            <li>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): Used for error detection.</li><br>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>Ethernet's key advantages include high data transfer speeds, reliability, and flexibility in wired and wireless configurations. However, wireless Ethernet can suffer from slower speeds and reduced security. Ethernet's use of firewalls and other security measures helps mitigate some risks.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.5 FDDI:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a set of ANSI and ISO standards for data transmission in Local Area Networks (LANs) using fiber-optic cables. It supports high-speed communication over long distances, with a geographical reach of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles). FDDI provides a data rate of 100 Mbps, with the ability to double the capacity to 200 Mbps through its dual-ring structure.</p><br>
                        <p>The FDDI frame format includes:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preamble: Synchronization for the start of a frame.</li><br>
                            <li>Start Delimiter: Indicates the beginning of the frame.</li><br>
                            <li>Frame Control: Defines whether the frame is for data or control.</li><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Token Ring is a Local Area Network (LAN) protocol where stations are connected in a single ring. A "token" is passed around the ring, granting the right to transmit data to the station that holds it. This reduces data collisions and ensures orderly communication.</p><br>
                        <p>Key aspects of Token Ring:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Token Passing: Only the station with the token can send data.</li><br>
                            <li>Ring Latency: The time it takes for a bit to travel around the ring, influenced by ring size, station count, and transmission speed.</li><br>
                            <li>Cycle Time: The time for the token to complete a full loop around the ring, influenced by Token Holding Time (THT) and propagation delay.</li><br>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>Token Ring frame format includes:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start Delimiter: Marks the beginning of a frame.</li><br>
                            <li>Frame Control: Indicates whether the frame carries data or control information.</li><br>

                        <h3>2.5 Resilient Packet Ring:</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), standardized as IEEE 802.17, is a data transmission protocol designed for fiber-optic ring networks, operating at the Media Access Control (MAC) layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It improves efficiency for Ethernet and IP services while ensuring high bandwidth utilization and optimized operational costs.</p><br>
                        <p>RPR networks consist of dual counter-rotating fiber-optic rings, known as ringlets. Data transmission occurs along both ringlets, maximizing bandwidth utilization. Unlike traditional dual-ring systems, which reserve one ring for backup, RPR uses both rings for active data transmission, enhancing throughput.</p><br>
                        <p>Control signals in RPR travel in the opposite direction of data traffic, allowing efficient management of network resources. This design helps maintain communication even in the event of a link failure. RPR also incorporates Quality of Service (QoS) features, enabling it to prioritize traffic based on importance, which reduces congestion and minimizes transmission failures.</p><br>
                        <p>RPR provides two methods to handle link failures: steering and wrapping. In steering, nodes are informed of a broken link and reroute traffic accordingly. In wrapping, data traffic is looped back at the last node before the breakage, ensuring it reaches its destination via the other ringlet. These mechanisms provide high resilience and continuity of service.</p><br>

                        <h3>2.9 RFID</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless technology that uses radio waves to uniquely identify and track objects, animals, or people. It consists of RFID tags, which store data, and RFID readers, which retrieve data from the tags. RFID operates without a direct line-of-sight, allowing for efficient data capture in various settings.</p><br>
                        <p>There are two main types of RFID: passive and active. Passive RFID tags do not have their own power source and rely on energy from the RFID reader, offering a shorter range but lower costs. Active RFID tags have an internal power source, enabling longer-range communication and more flexibility.</p><br>
                        <p>RFID is used in a range of applications, including inventory management, asset tracking, and access control. It is common in warehouses and retail stores for inventory tracking and in supply chain management to monitor goods. RFID can also be found in personnel tracking through ID badges and in access control for secure areas.</p><br>

                    <h2>UNIT 3: Data Link Layer</h2>
                    <br>
                    <section>
                        <h3>3.1 Data Link Layer Design Issues</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Data Link Layer is the second layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnections) model, serving as an intermediary between the physical layer, which handles the raw transmission of bits, and the network layer, which manages packet routing and delivery. The Data Link Layer has several crucial design issues and functions that help ensure reliable data transmission and error handling in a computer network.</p><br>
                        <h4>Services Provided to network layer:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unacknowledged Connectionless Service: This service sends frames without expecting an acknowledgment from the receiver, suitable for low-error environments.</li><br>
                            <li>Acknowledged Connectionless Service: In this service, frames are sent with acknowledgment, allowing for retransmission if an error occurs.</li><br>
                            <li>Acknowledged Connection-Oriented Service: This service establishes a connection and uses acknowledgments to ensure reliable delivery, similar to TCP in the transport layer.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Framing:</h4>
                        <p>Framing is the process by which the Data Link Layer encapsulates data packets from the network layer into frames for transmission. Frames consist of a header, payload, and trailer. The header contains control information like source and destination addresses, the payload is the actual data being transmitted, and the trailer may contain error-checking codes such as cyclic redundancy checks (CRC). Framing can use fixed-length or variable-length methods, with each approach requiring different handling of the start and end of the frame.</p><br>
                        <h4>Error Control:</h4>
                        <p>Error Control is crucial in the Data Link Layer to ensure reliable communication. It addresses issues related to transmission errors by using error detection techniques and retransmission strategies. Error control mechanisms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Error Detection: Using methods like CRC to detect corrupted frames.</li><br>
                            <li>Acknowledgment: Sending acknowledgment frames to confirm successful receipt.</li><br>
                            <li>Retransmission: Resending lost or corrupted frames to maintain data integrity.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Flow Control:</h4>
                        <p>Flow Control is implemented to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver, which can cause frame loss. Common flow control techniques are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stop-and-Wait: The sender waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next frame.</li><br>
                            <li>Sliding Window: The sender can send multiple frames before receiving an acknowledgment, enhancing efficiency.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                        <h3>3.2 Error Detection and Correction</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Error detection and correction are essential in computer networks to ensure reliable communication. When data is transmitted, it can get corrupted due to noise or interference, leading to errors where bits are altered. Error detection involves adding extra information, such as parity bits or checksums, to help identify if errors occurred during transmission. Common techniques include Simple Parity Check, Two-dimensional Parity Check, Checksum, and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). These methods can detect single-bit errors and burst errors, helping maintain data integrity.</p><br>
                        <p>For error correction, there are two primary approaches: Forward Error Correction (FEC) and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ). FEC allows the receiver to correct errors without retransmission by using redundant data, while ARQ relies on the receiver requesting retransmission of corrupted data. Although these mechanisms improve data reliability and network performance, they add some overhead and can lead to false positives, where errors are incorrectly flagged, or limited error correction. Despite these drawbacks, error detection and correction play a vital role in ensuring accurate data communication and enhancing overall network security.</p><br>

                        <h3>3.3 Error Correcting code</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Error-correcting codes are designed to not only detect errors but also correct them without the need for retransmission. They add redundancy to the data, allowing the system to identify and fix errors automatically. ECCs are particularly useful in environments where retransmission is costly or impossible, such as in satellite communications or deep-space missions. Some common types of ECCs include:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hamming Code: It can correct single-bit errors and detect double-bit errors.</li><br>
                            <li>Reed-Solomon Code: Widely used in CDs, DVDs, and QR codes, this code can correct burst errors.</li><br>
                            <li>Turbo Codes and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) Codes: These codes are used in advanced communication systems like 4G/5G cellular networks due to their high error-correcting capabilities.</li><br>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>3.4 Error Detecting code</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Error-detecting codes focus on identifying errors during data transmission or storage, signaling the need for retransmission or additional checks. These codes add a smaller amount of redundancy compared to ECCs, allowing for simpler error detection. Common error-detecting codes include:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Parity Check: Adds a parity bit to ensure an even or odd number of 1s in the data. It is simple but cannot correct errors.</li><br>
                            <li>Checksum: Computes a sum of the data, typically in network protocols, to detect errors in data packets.</li><br>
                            <li>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): Uses polynomial division to detect errors in data blocks. CRC is used in network protocols like Ethernet and storage devices.</li><br>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>4.1 IPv4/IPv6</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>An Internet Protocol Address (IP address) is a unique identifier for computers and other devices to communicate over the internet. The two main types of IP addresses are IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6).</p><br>
                        <h4>IPv4:</h4>
                        <p>IPv4, the first widely used version, was introduced in 1981 by DARPA and deployed for production on SATNET and the ARPANET in 1983. It uses a 32-bit address format, represented as four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 189.123.123.90). Each number ranges from 0 to 255 and must be converted to binary for computer understanding.</p><br>
                        <p>IPv4 is still prevalent today, especially in older systems. Its structure and simplicity make it easier to use and manage, but it has limitations in address space, resulting in the exhaustion of available addresses.</p><br>
                        <h4>IPv6:</h4>
                        <p>IPv6 was introduced in 1995 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to address the shortcomings of IPv4, particularly the limited address space. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format, represented as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). This expanded structure allows for a vastly larger address pool.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.2 Router and Routing algorithms</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Routing algorithms determine the best path for sending packets from a source to a destination in a network. These algorithms fall into two categories: Adaptive (Dynamic) and Non-Adaptive (Static).</p><br>
                        <h4>Adaptive Routing Algorithms:</h4>
                        <p>Adaptive Routing Algorithms are dynamic and adjust based on network conditions and traffic. They can be classified into three types: Centralized, where global knowledge is used to compute the best path; Isolation, which relies on local information; and Distributed, where nodes iteratively build routing tables from local data. This approach allows for real-time adaptation but is more complex.</p><br>
                        <h4>Non-Adaptive Routing Algorithms:</h4>
                        <p>Non-Adaptive Routing Algorithms are static, with routing tables pre-configured at network setup. This category includes Flooding, where packets are sent to all outgoing links except the source link, and Random Walks, where packets are sent to a random neighboring node. While simpler and requiring less computation, these algorithms don't adapt to changing network conditions.</p><br>
                        <p>Adaptive algorithms are more flexible and suitable for networks with varying traffic and topology, while Non-Adaptive algorithms are best for stable, predictable networks.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.3 Distance Vector</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is a routing protocol where routers share information about network topology changes with their immediate neighbors. Based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm, each router maintains a Distance Vector (DV) table indicating the estimated distance to various destinations. The distances are updated based on routing information received from neighboring routers and changes in link status.</p><br>
                        <p>DVR is simple to configure and maintain, making it suitable for smaller networks. However, it has drawbacks such as slower convergence, risk of routing loops (count-to-infinity problem), and increased network traffic due to periodic updates. Additionally, DVR requires routers to maintain information on all possible destinations, leading to larger routing tables and potential congestion, especially in larger networks. Despite its limitations, DVR provides a foundational approach to routing with relatively low computational requirements.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.4 Link State</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Link State Routing is a method used in networking where each router shares its direct connections with every other router in the network, ensuring that all routers have a comprehensive view of the network topology. This technique involves reliable flooding, where each router broadcasts information about its directly attached links and their costs. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows routers to calculate the optimal routes to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm, resulting in accurate and efficient routing decisions.</p><br>
                        <p>While Link State Routing provides a high level of accuracy, it has some drawbacks, including increased network traffic due to flooding and higher complexity compared to other routing methods. The complexity arises from the need for routers to maintain and process more detailed network information. Despite these challenges, Link State Routing is a powerful tool for complex networks requiring precise and dynamic routing capabilities.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.5 TCP and UDP</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols with distinct characteristics. TCP is connection-oriented, ensuring reliable and ordered data delivery. It establishes a communication channel through a handshake process and implements flow control, error correction, and packet sequencing. This makes TCP ideal for applications like web browsing, file transfers, and email, where data integrity and reliability are crucial. However, TCP's connection-oriented nature can lead to slower speeds and higher overhead.</p><br>
                        <p>UDP is connectionless, favoring speed and simplicity over reliability. It does not require a handshake or connection setup, allowing for fast, low-latency communication. UDP is typically used in real-time applications like gaming, video streaming, and online voice or video chats, where slight data loss is acceptable. The lack of connection management and error correction makes UDP faster but less reliable. It supports broadcasting and multicasting, unlike TCP. However, UDP's connectionless design means there's no guarantee of data delivery, no packet retransmission, and no sequencing, requiring applications to handle these aspects if needed.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.6 Socket</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>A socket is an endpoint for communication between two programs on a network, allowing inter-process communication (IPC). Each socket has a unique address composed of an IP address and a port number. Sockets are used in client-server applications, where the server creates a socket, binds it to a port, and listens for connections, while the client creates a socket and connects to the server.</p><br>
                        <p>There are two main types of sockets:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Datagram Sockets: These are connectionless, used for sending and receiving packets without establishing a connection. Ideal for fast, low-overhead communication like UDP.</li>
                            <li>Stream Sockets: These are connection-oriented, providing a reliable, sequenced flow of data, similar to TCP.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>Common socket functions include:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Socket() to create a socket.</li>
                            <li>Bind() to associate a socket with an IP address and port.</li>
                            <li>Listen() to prepare for incoming connections.</li>
                            <li>Connect() to establish a connection.</li>
                            <li>Accept() to accept a client connection.</li>
                            <li>Read() and Write() to receive and send data.</li>
                            <li>Close() to end the connection.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>Sockets are foundational for networked applications, with Datagram sockets used for lightweight, fast communication, and Stream sockets used for reliable, ordered data transfer.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.7 General Principles</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Congestion control in computer networks focuses on managing and preventing traffic overloads. The primary approaches are open loop and closed loop control. Open loop congestion control is preventive, designed to avoid congestion before it starts. It includes several key principles: the retransmission policy, which minimizes packet retransmissions to reduce network load; the window policy, which uses selective repeat to avoid redundant retransmissions; the discarding policy, allowing routers to discard less critical or corrupted packets to keep traffic manageable; the acknowledgment policy, which uses techniques like cumulative or delayed acknowledgments to reduce overhead; and the admission policy, where routers check network resources before allowing new flows to prevent overload.</p><br>
                        <p>Closed loop congestion control, on the other hand, is reactive, addressing congestion after it has occurred. It relies on feedback mechanisms to control traffic. Key principles here include backpressure, where a congested node stops receiving packets, signaling upstream nodes to slow down; the choke packet technique, where a signal is sent to the source to reduce traffic; implicit signaling, where congestion is inferred from delayed or missing acknowledgments; and explicit signaling, where direct signals about congestion are sent to the source or destination, which can occur in either forward or backward direction.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.8 Congestion Prevention policies</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Congestion prevention policies in computer networks focus on strategies that reduce or avoid network congestion before it occurs. Here are the main policies:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Retransmission Policy: This policy handles packet retransmissions when packets are lost or corrupted. To prevent increasing congestion, retransmission timers must be carefully managed to avoid excessive retransmissions while maintaining efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Window Policy: The type of window control used by the sender can impact congestion. The Go-back-n window may lead to congestion due to resending multiple packets, even if only a few are lost. The Selective Repeat window is a better alternative, allowing only specific lost packets to be retransmitted, reducing congestion.</li>
                            <li>Discarding Policy: Routers can use a discarding policy to prevent congestion by dropping less sensitive or corrupted packets. This can be useful in cases like audio file transmission, where quality can be maintained despite some packet loss.</li>
                            <li>Acknowledgment Policy: This policy manages how acknowledgments are sent to avoid adding unnecessary load to the network. Sending acknowledgments for multiple packets, or only when a timer expires, can help reduce congestion.</li>
                            <li>Admission Policy: This policy requires switches to check resource availability before allowing a network flow. If there's a risk of congestion, routers can deny virtual connections to prevent further congestion. This proactive approach can help maintain network stability.</li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <p>Load shedding is a network congestion control technique that discards packets when a router's buffer is full. This is necessary when network resources are insufficient to handle the traffic load. There are several approaches to load shedding: random selection, application-based, priority-based, and random early detection (RED). Random selection involves discarding packets arbitrarily, which can lead to undesired outcomes. Application-based discards old or new packets depending on the type of application. Priority-based chooses packets to discard based on their assigned priority, while RED discards packets before the buffer becomes completely full, reducing the chance of severe congestion. Load shedding helps manage network traffic and prevents congestion, but it has drawbacks, including potential data loss, overhead for routers, and limited effectiveness in avoiding congestion entirely. Proper implementation requires careful consideration of the strategy to balance network efficiency and packet integrity.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.10 Jitter Control</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Jitter in computer networks is the variability in data transmission delays, which can affect real-time applications like video conferencing and VoIP. It is caused by factors such as network congestion and packet loss.</p><br>
                        <p>Network congestion leads to jitter when devices cannot process incoming packets quickly enough, causing buffers to fill and creating delays. This can result in packet loss when packets are discarded due to buffer overflow, impacting the quality of real-time communications.</p><br>
                        <p>To manage jitter, jitter buffers are used at the receiving end of connections to store incoming packets and normalize their arrival times. There are two types of jitter buffers:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Static Jitter Buffers are hardware-based and have fixed configurations.</li><br>
                            <li>Dynamic Jitter Buffers are software-based and can adjust to changing network conditions.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Jitter control is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable performance in real-time network applications. Effective jitter management reduces disruptions like choppy audio and pixelated video.</p><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Quality of Service (QoS) in computer networks refers to mechanisms that manage and control network traffic, ensuring critical applications get the resources they need for optimal performance. It's especially important when network capacity is limited, and multiple applications compete for bandwidth.</p><br>
                        <p>QoS is often used in networks with resource-intensive applications like Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), online gaming, streaming media, videoconferencing, Video on Demand (VOD), and Voice over IP (VoIP). These applications require dedicated bandwidth, low latency, and controlled jitter to function properly.</p><br>
                        <p>The primary goal of QoS is to prioritize traffic, enabling network administrators to allocate bandwidth, manage packet queues, and control packet loss to ensure a high level of service quality. QoS helps avoid network congestion and provides a smoother user experience by allowing organizations to set traffic priorities.</p><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Packet scheduling in computer networks manages data packet transmission by determining their order and timing. This technique is crucial for optimizing network traffic, reducing congestion, and ensuring that high-priority packets are transmitted quickly. It's particularly important in networks with limited bandwidth and where multiple applications compete for resources.</p><br>
                        <p>Packet scheduling aims to achieve fairness, minimize latency, maximize throughput, and control jitter. Fairness ensures that all users and applications receive an equitable share of resources, while minimizing latency is critical for time-sensitive applications like VoIP and video conferencing. Throughput maximization focuses on transmitting as much data as possible in a given time, and jitter control reduces variability in packet arrival times.</p><br>
                        <p>Common packet scheduling techniques include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Priority Scheduling, Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), Round Robin (RR), Deficit Round Robin (DRR), and Shortest Job First (SJF). Each has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the network's specific needs.</p><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Traffic shaping in computer networks is a technique used to control data flow and ensure quality of service (QoS). It involves regulating the transmission of packets to manage network congestion and prioritize critical applications. Common methods include data transfer throttling, which controls packet flow into a network, and rate limiting, which regulates the flow out of a network.</p><br>
                        <p>Key components of traffic shaping are burst size, average bandwidth, and peak bandwidth. Burst size represents the maximum data allowed to be transmitted in a burst, while average bandwidth and peak bandwidth define the sustained and maximum data rates, respectively. Traffic shaping often uses a leaky bucket algorithm, where excess packets are stored in a buffer and released gradually to smooth traffic flow and prevent overloading the network.</p><br>
                        <p>Traffic shaping is used to ensure business-critical applications, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and video conferencing, receive priority during high network demand. It can also help internet service providers (ISPs) manage customer traffic by setting bandwidth limits on certain applications or services.</p><br>

                        <h3>4.14 Integrated Services</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Integrated services in computer networks refer to the ability to transmit different types of data—such as voice, video, and general data—over a single network infrastructure. This approach streamlines communication by integrating various services into one network system. A key example is Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), which allows simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, and data over the same lines.</p><br>
                        <p>ISDN uses circuit-switched and packet-switched connections, offering improved data quality and flexibility compared to traditional analog systems. It has two main interfaces: Basic Rate Interface (BRI), which has two data-bearing channels and one signaling channel, and Primary Rate Interface (PRI), which offers higher bandwidth with 23 or 30 data channels and one signaling channel.</p><br>
                        <p>While integrated services can lead to more efficient communication and better bandwidth utilization, they also require specialized equipment and can be more expensive than traditional systems. Despite these drawbacks, the concept of integrated services has had a lasting impact on modern computer networks, laying the groundwork for more advanced communication technologies.</p><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial part of computer networks that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and online services without memorizing complex numbers. DNS functions as a distributed directory service, with a hierarchical structure that efficiently resolves domain names.</p><br>
                        <p>DNS operates through a network of name servers, starting with root DNS servers at the top, which direct queries to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) servers. These TLD servers then point to the authoritative name servers that hold the specific IP addresses for each domain. When a user enters a domain name, the local DNS resolver sends a query through this hierarchy to obtain the correct IP address.</p><br>
                        <p>DNS supports different types of domains, including generic domains like .com and .org, country-specific domains like .us, and inverse domains, which map IP addresses back to domain names. It also employs various query methods, such as recursive, iterative, and non-recursive queries, to efficiently resolve domain names.</p><br>
                        <p>DNS caching plays an important role by storing previously resolved information, reducing query time for frequently accessed domains. This caching mechanism improves performance and reduces network traffic.</p><br>
                        <p>Overall, DNS is essential for the internet's functionality, allowing users to navigate the web easily and providing a scalable solution for managing domain names and IP addresses.</p><br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an application layer protocol used to send emails across computer networks, primarily over the internet. It operates as a push protocol, responsible for transmitting email from the sender's client to the receiver's server. SMTP usually works on port 25 and is a key component in email delivery systems.</p><br>
                        <p>SMTP involves several key elements:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mail User Agent (MUA): The email client used by the sender to compose and send messages.</li><br>
                            <li>Mail Submission Agent (MSA): Receives email from the MUA and submits it to the SMTP server for further processing.</li><br>
                            <li>Mail Transfer Agent (MTA): The server that transfers email to the recipient's server, using TCP connections.</li><br>
                            <li>Mail Delivery Agent (MDA): Receives email from the MTA and delivers it to the recipient's mailbox for retrieval.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The process of sending email with SMTP includes several steps:</p><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Submission: The MUA submits the email to the MSA, which then sends it to the SMTP server.</li><br>
                            <li>Transmission: The SMTP server establishes a connection with the recipient's MTA and sends the email. This may involve multiple MTAs if the email needs to be relayed.</li><br>
                            <li>Delivery: Once the email reaches the recipient's domain, the MDA stores it in the recipient's mailbox.</li><br>
                            <li>Retrieval: The recipient uses an MUA to retrieve and read the email.</li><br>
                        </ul>
                        <p>SMTP has some limitations, such as lack of authentication and security, but Extended SMTP (ESMTP) provides additional features, including support for multimedia attachments and stronger authentication mechanisms.

                        <h3>5.7 Basics of Public key and Private key Cryptography</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Public key and private key cryptography are key concepts in the field of cryptography, used to secure communication and ensure data integrity. These terms refer to encryption and decryption mechanisms in computer security.</p><br>
                        <p><strong>Public Key Cryptography:</strong></p><br>
                        <p>Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, involves two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the corresponding private key is used to decrypt it. This method allows secure data exchange without the need to share the decryption key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can access the encrypted information.</p><br>
                        <p><strong>Private Key Cryptography:</strong></p><br>
                        <p>Private key cryptography, also known as symmetric cryptography, uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. This key must be shared between the sender and the receiver, making it crucial to keep it secret. Symmetric cryptography is typically faster than asymmetric cryptography due to its simpler encryption algorithms.</p><br>
                        <p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages:</strong></p><br>
                        <p><strong>Public Key Cryptography:</strong> It provides better security for key exchange and is suitable for public use. However, it is slower and less efficient for large-scale data encryption.</p><br>
                        <p><strong>Private Key Cryptography:</strong> It is faster and more efficient for encrypting large volumes of data. However, it requires secure key distribution and is vulnerable to key loss.</p><br>
                        <p>Public key and private key cryptography serve different purposes and are used in various applications to ensure secure communication and data protection. Public key cryptography is essential for secure key exchange and digital signatures, while private key cryptography is ideal for high-speed data encryption. Understanding the differences and appropriate applications for each type of cryptography is crucial for implementing effective security solutions.</p><br>

                        <h3>5.8 Digital Signatures and Certificates</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Digital signatures and digital certificates are key components of secure digital communication, each serving distinct but related purposes. A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document. It involves creating a unique signature by encrypting a message digest with a private key, which can be verified by decrypting it with the corresponding public key. This process confirms the identity of the sender and assures that the content has not been altered, providing non-repudiation since the sender cannot deny their involvement.</p><br>
                        <p>On the other hand, a digital certificate is a public key certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). It acts as a digital ID that ties a public key to a specific entity, such as a user, device, or website. A digital certificate contains details like the certificate holder's name, expiration date, public key, and the digital signature of the CA. This certificate is essential for verifying the identity of users and for establishing secure connections, especially in protocols like SSL/TLS for websites.</p><br>
                        <p>While digital signatures offer benefits like authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation, digital certificates provide identity verification and enhance trust in online interactions. However, both have their drawbacks. Digital signatures can be complex to implement and, if not properly secured, may be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Digital certificates require careful management to avoid misconfiguration and can be subject to phishing attacks if malicious actors create fake certificates.</p><br>
                        <p>In summary, digital signatures ensure that a document's origin and integrity are maintained, whereas digital certificates verify identities and enable secure communication. Together, they form the backbone of digital security, ensuring that electronic transactions and communications are both secure and trustworthy.</p><br>

                        <h3>5.9 Firewalls</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Firewalls are a crucial component of network security, acting as barriers between private internal networks and external sources like the public Internet. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a predefined set of security rules, determining whether to accept, reject, or drop specific data packets. This function helps prevent unauthorized access, malware, and other network-based threats.</p><br>
                        <p>Historically, network security was managed through Access Control Lists (ACLs) on routers, but these lacked the ability to effectively block sophisticated threats. Firewalls emerged as a more robust solution, with various types developed over time. Packet-filtering firewalls were the first generation, monitoring packets' source, destination, and port to decide whether to allow or block them. Stateful firewalls followed, tracking the state of connections to offer more refined control over network traffic.</p><br>
                        <p>Firewalls can be either hardware or software-based. Hardware firewalls are physical devices that attach to networks and act as gateways, while software firewalls are programs installed on computers. Cloud-based firewalls, or "firewall as a service" (FaaS), offer centralized management and scalability for organizations with distributed networks.</p><br>
                        <p>Different types of firewalls serve various purposes. Packet-filtering firewalls examine individual packets based on a set of rules. Stateful firewalls consider the context of traffic and are more effective against certain attacks. Application layer firewalls work at the application level, blocking specific content or application misuse. Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) include additional features like deep packet inspection and intrusion prevention.</p><br>
